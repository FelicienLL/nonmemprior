# nonmemprior

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of nonmemprior is to automatically return the code text that you need to include in order to use $PRIOR routine in NONMEM. Automatic computation of variance and degree of freedom to pass to NWPRI. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FelicienLL/nonmemprior")
```
## Features
What does nonmemprior doesn't do: 

* Dealing with omega blocks (I should look into it)
* Dealing with log transformed parameters and mu-referencing (don't know if necessary ?)
* Taking information from a NMXML file (should it ?)
* Taking information from a xpose file (I should look into it)
